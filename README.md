# Deepgram Meeting STT

An Obsidian plugin that transcribes meeting recordings with the [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com) speech-to-text API and saves them as markdown notes with per-speaker timestamps.

---

## Features

- **Right-click → transcribe**: pick any audio file from the vault sidebar (or run the command palette) and the transcription lands in a new markdown note
- **Per-speaker diarization** with `[HH:MM:SS]` segment timestamps
- **Optional custom templates** with token substitution
- **Bilingual UI** (Korean / English / auto-follow Obsidian locale)
- **Zero Retention by default** — Deepgram discards audio + transcripts after processing (plan-dependent)
- **Auto-managed workspace**: creates `ObsiDeep/` (Audio/, STT/) at the vault root and writes vault `.gitignore` rules so recordings and your API key stay out of vault git sync
- **Mobile compatible** — works on Obsidian for iOS / Android

## Install

1. **Settings → Community plugins → Browse**
2. Search for **"Deepgram Meeting STT"**
3. Install + Enable

## Setup

On first enable, a one-time consent modal walks you through what's sent to Deepgram and auto-creates an `ObsiDeep/` workspace at the vault root plus `.gitignore` rules to keep recordings and your API key out of git sync.

Then get a Deepgram API key:

1. Sign up at [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com) — free tier includes a **$200 credit** (~770 hours of `nova-3`).

2. **API Keys → Create New API Key** (any name, `Member` permission is enough).

3. Paste into **Settings → Deepgram Meeting STT → "Deepgram API key"** → click **Validate**.

## Usage

### Drop a recording and transcribe

1. Place an audio file (`mp3`, `m4a`, `mp4`, `wav`, `flac`, `ogg`, `opus`, `webm`, `aac`) into `ObsiDeep/Audio/` (drag into the Obsidian window, or copy via Finder/Explorer)
2. **Right-click** the file in Obsidian's left sidebar → **"Transcribe with Deepgram"**
3. Enter a title → Enter
4. After ~1–2 minutes the transcribed note appears in `ObsiDeep/STT/` and opens automatically

The same flow is available from the command palette (`Cmd+P` / `Ctrl+P`) → **"Transcribe audio → meeting note"**.

> If you copied the file via Finder/Explorer and it doesn't appear in the sidebar right away, run `Cmd+P` → **"Reload app without saving"** first.

### Output

# Stand-up 2026-05-13

**Speaker 1** [00:00:01 - 00:00:08]
Good morning, let's start with the status updates.

**Speaker 2** [00:00:09 - 00:00:14]
Sure, I'll go first.
```

### Rename speakers

Speakers are labelled `Speaker 1`, `Speaker 2` by default. To replace with real names:

1. Open the meeting note
2. Command palette → **"Rename speaker (current note)"**

![Rename speaker command](img/img5.webp)

3. Pick the speaker from the dropdown (auto-detected from the note's frontmatter)
4. Type the real name → click **Replace**

Every occurrence in both the body and the `speakers` frontmatter array is rewritten.

## Security & Privacy

- Audio is sent to Deepgram over HTTPS for processing.
- Your API key is stored locally as plain JSON in `.obsidian/plugins/deepgram-meeting-stt/data.json` (Obsidian plugin standard). The plugin auto-adds this path to your vault's `.gitignore`.
- The `ObsiDeep/` folder is also auto-added to `.gitignore` so recordings and notes never enter vault git sync.
- Deepgram complies with **GDPR / SOC 2 Type II / HIPAA (with BAA) / CCPA**. See [Deepgram Trust Center](https://trust.deepgram.com) and [Privacy Policy](https://deepgram.com/privacy).
- **Zero Retention** is on by default. Guaranteed immediate effect on Growth or higher Deepgram plans; free / Pay-as-you-go tier may still retain data per standard policy (~30 days).
- Please obtain consent from meeting participants before recording and transmitting audio to a third-party API.

## Cost

Approximate cost with `nova-3`:

| Length | Cost (USD) |
|---|---|
| 30 min | $0.13 |
| 1 hour | $0.26 |
| 2 hours | $0.52 |

The free $200 signup credit covers many hours. See [Deepgram Pricing](https://deepgram.com/pricing) for current rates.
